So the selection box thing that all RTS games have.

For now I just need it to print the number of units it hit. It doesn’t need visuals either.

I wonder if it’s better to use a collider or a raycast for this. Hmm…
I will use a raycast for now, but yeah I’m not sure about that.

One of the things that complicate it, is that most RTS games have it so that the box will highlight units inside of it, before you’ve released it and selected those units.
