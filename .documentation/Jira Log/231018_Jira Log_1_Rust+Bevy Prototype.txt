Story
Rust+Bevy Prototype 1

- No pathfinding
- Use sprite colour or something basic like itIn order to show if a Unit has a spear or not
- Use a counter for the barrel
- No shaman
- Add spawner enemyAnd grunt enemy
- Time lerp enemy spawning system

That is the end-game of the prototype. For this particular prototype though, I am wrapping it up now, so I can refactor the code.

Task
Linear transform movement

Get the transform to move, not teleport.

==
ART-16
Task
Multi-unit movement

==
ART-17
Task
Unit moving state

Right now units always move.
They have a target destination and they will always be moving to it.
Even if they are right ontop of it they will still keep moving around it.
Unless they somehow manage to have their position and target line up exactly creating a 0 vector in the movement calculation.
