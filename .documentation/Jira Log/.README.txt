What're these
These are just .txt files that I manually create, to save the Jira issue history
I save them cause Jira projects die after a bit

Since I manually make them, you can expect some sprints to maybe not have one of these
And for some data to be inconsistently formatted and incorrect
It might also be that I elaborate on certain things from time to time
